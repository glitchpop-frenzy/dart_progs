# dart_progs
This repository contains dart programs from textbook "Dart: Up and Running"

Dart is expected to help in 2 ways:

1) _Better Performance_ : A more structured language is easier to optimize, and a fresh VM enables improvements such as faster startup.
2) _Better Productivity_ : Support for libraries and packages helps you work with other   developers and easily reuse code from other projects.

## What's cool about Dart?

* _Dart is easy to learn_. It’s an object-oriented language with classes, single inheritance, lexical scope, top-level functions, and a familiar syntax.
* _Dart compiles to JavaScript_. Dart has been designed from the start to compile to JavaScript, so that Dart apps can run across the entire modern web.
* _Dart runs in the client and on the server_. With built-in library support for files, directories, sockets, and even web servers, you can use Dart for full end-to-end apps.
* _Dart supports type without requiring them_. You can omit types when you want to move very quickly, aren’t sure what structure to take, or simply want to express something you can’t with the type system.
* _Dart scales from small scripts to large, complex apps_.
* _Dart has a wide array of built-in libraries_.
* _Dart supports safe, simple concurrency with isolates_. Dart's isolates, inspired by ![Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)), provide an easier to understand model for running isolates, but concurrent, portions of your code. Spawning new isolates is cheal and fast, and no state is shared.
* _Dart supports code sharing_. With Dart package manager (![pub](https://pub.dev/)) and language features such as libraries, you can easily discover, install, and integrate code from the web and enterprise.

## A Tour of the Dart Language

```main()``` : The special, _required_, top-level function where the app execution starts.
